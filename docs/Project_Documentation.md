## 2. Introduction

This project involves creating a Job Portal website that helps job seekers find employment opportunities and employers post job listings. The platform allows users to search for jobs by various criteria, apply to positions, and track their applications.

The project helps to create a clear understanding on how to create a dynamic, responsive website and use the concepts of web development in a job search and recruitment platform.

The website is created in REACT Framework. It uses JavaScript, HTML and CSS files and concepts. 
Datasets are created using JSON objects within the document itself.

### Project Objectives:
1. Create an intuitive and user-friendly platform for job seekers and employers
2. Implement efficient job search and application processes
3. Provide robust profile management for both job seekers and employers
4. Ensure secure and reliable user authentication
5. Deliver a responsive and accessible interface across all devices

### Problem Statement:
The traditional job search and recruitment process often suffers from:
- Inefficient communication between job seekers and employers
- Lack of centralized platforms for job postings
- Time-consuming application processes
- Difficulty in tracking application status
- Limited access to job opportunities

These challenges not only waste valuable time for both job seekers and employers but also lead to missed opportunities and increased hiring costs. Our research showed that the average job seeker spends countless hours on multiple platforms, while employers struggle to find qualified candidates efficiently.

### Solution Overview:
Our Job Portal addresses these challenges by providing:
- A centralized platform for job postings and applications
- Advanced search and filtering capabilities
- Real-time application tracking
- Secure user authentication
- Responsive design for all devices

The solution was designed with a user-centric approach, focusing on creating an intuitive and efficient experience for both job seekers and employers. Through careful planning and implementation, we've created a platform that streamlines the entire recruitment process.

### Technologies and Frameworks Used:
- **Frontend:**
  - React.js with Material-UI for modern, responsive UI
  - React Hooks for efficient state management
  - React Router for seamless navigation
  - Formik with Yup for robust form handling
  - Material-UI components for consistent design
  - Custom CSS for enhanced styling

- **Development Tools:**
  - Git for version control
  - npm for package management
  - VS Code for development
  - Chrome DevTools for debugging

The technology stack was carefully chosen to ensure scalability, maintainability, and optimal performance. Each technology was selected based on its proven track record and ability to meet our specific requirements.

## 3. Project Structure

The entire project is maintained inside one main REACT folder. It contains subfolders like node_modules, public, src and two json files â€“ package-lock.json and package.json.

The node modules folder is a 3rd party document that contains various files that need not be altered in anyway. 

The public folder stores static assets like images, fonts, and favicons that don't require processing by the React application. It contains the index.html file which serves as the entry point for the website in a production environment. It typically references the built JavaScript bundle.

The src folder holds the source code for the React components and application logic. For this project, it contains folders like assets which carries images, components which contains source codes for different website components that are used in multiple pages, context folder which contains contexts for certain elements, pages which contain sources for the different webpages, and files like app.js and its CSS, database JSON files, etc.

### Key Components of the Job Portal:
